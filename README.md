# chordMarkdown

**Dedicated to run only in Pythonista3 (iOS) environment.**

This is my private musical Domain Specified Language (DSL),
for easy 'Music Analyse' based on 'functional chords' and 'modes.'

This language very focuses 'Chord Progression' and significally 'Simple Writing down Chords.'

Thus, I call this Python library as a type of 'Music Markdown.'

It bases on:

* Relative pitch
* Based on basic modes
* Based on basic chords along each mode (triad, tetrad and so on)

## Language Example 

[TODO]

## Run

1. Open "main.py" and
2. Describe chord and mode sections
3. And Run it.
